This was done via the [ELMS assignment](). (we'll post an announcement when this is ready!)

### Part 2 (75 pts)

As an auditor for the company, I would be responsible for alerting my boss and any higher-ups of any security issues I find. These are the only individuals with the authority to delay the release of our engine control units. If they are unwilling to postpone the release, I would not inform anyone else of the vulnerabilities. Reasons for the delay could include a release deadline and not enough money to fund the required twenty developers for fixing the problems. 
Some may suggest that warning consumers of the security risk would be the ethical thing to do. The public deserves to know about the dangers that come with the products they purchase. The issue is with this stance is that previously dormant attackers will become aware of the ECU's vulnerabilities. By the time my employers gather the resources needed to solve the issue, attackers will have plenty of time to attempt exploiting the device. If it took me six months to identify the security flaws as a junior developer, seasoned attackers will most definitely cause havoc during the estimated six months needed to patch the issues. By not publicly acknowledging the problem, consumers may be safer from malicious attacks.
One possible form of compromise is to release vehicles with flawed ECUs and then work on patches afterward. Requesting a mandatory recall after proper fixes are put in place will reduce the risk of future attacks.
